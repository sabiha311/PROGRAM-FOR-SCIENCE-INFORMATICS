# DNA Sequence Analysis

This project performs analysis on a DNA sequence extracted from a FASTA file. It includes functionalities to read the sequence, generate the reverse complement, count nucleotide occurrences in kilobases, and check for discrepancies in expected nucleotide counts.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10
- Ensure the FASTA file (e.g., `chr1_GL383518v1_alt.fa`) is available at the specified path.

## Usage

1. Update the `file_path` variable in the code to point to your FASTA file.
2. Run the script to perform the analysis.


python your_script.py
